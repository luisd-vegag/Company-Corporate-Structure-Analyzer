Sure, here are the steps to download and install the chromedriver binary file from the Chromium website:

Go to the following URL: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Scroll down to the section that says "Latest Release: ChromeDriver X.X.X.X" and find the version that corresponds to your Chrome browser version (you can check your Chrome version by typing "chrome://settings/help" in the address bar).

Click on the corresponding link for your operating system to download the chromedriver binary file.

Once the file has finished downloading, extract it from the zip file and save it to a location on your computer (e.g. /usr/local/bin/chromedriver).

Add the location of the chromedriver binary file to your system path. This can be done by adding the following line to your ~/.bash_profile file:

export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/chromedriver"

Replace "/path/to/chromedriver" with the actual location of the chromedriver binary file on your computer.

Save the changes to your ~/.bash_profile file and exit.

Open a new terminal window or source your ~/.bash_profile file to apply the changes to your system path.

After following these steps, you should be able to use the chromedriver binary file with your Python code.

TEST IT 
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from chromedriver_py import binary_path

service_object = Service(binary_path)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service_object)

# deprecated but works in older selenium versions
# driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=binary_path)
driver.get("http://www.example.com")
assert "Example Domain" in driver.title

# do more browser automation here

driver.quit()
